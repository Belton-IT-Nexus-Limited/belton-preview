            <h3>A near-miss that changed everything</h3>
            <p>A mid-sized Auckland law firm came to us after a phishing email nearly compromised their email system. A staff member had clicked a link and entered credentials before realising the mistake. They'd avoided disaster by sheer luck, but it exposed serious gaps in their security posture.</p>

            <p>We started with a full security assessment, identifying vulnerabilities across their environment. Then we implemented proper email security with advanced threat protection, deployed multi-factor authentication across all users, and established security awareness training. We also set up 24/7 threat monitoring through our global partner SOC network.</p>

            <p>Twelve months later, they've blocked over 400 sophisticated phishing attempts that would have reached inboxes under their old setup. More importantly, their staff now know what to look for and how to respond. When one partner received a convincing CEO fraud email, they reported it immediately rather than acting on it. Staff security awareness scores improved from 45% to 92%, and they've had zero successful breaches in 18 months.</p>

They're not just our IT provider, they're a genuine partner in our business."</p>

            <span class="case-tag">Cloud Migration</span>
            <h3>From aging servers to Azure, without the drama</h3>
            <p>A Hamilton-based manufacturer was running critical systems on servers approaching end of life. Their ERP system, file storage, and production planning tools all lived on hardware that was increasingly unreliable. Every time something failed, it affected production.</p>

            <p>We designed a migration plan that moved them to Azure infrastructure while maintaining their existing workflows. The key was doing it without disrupting production. We migrated systems in stages, moving non-critical workloads first to prove the approach, then tackling the ERP migration over a planned weekend.</p>

            <p>The transition went smoothly because we'd done the groundwork. Staff came in Monday morning to find everything working as expected, just faster and more reliable. Their IT person, who'd been spending most of their time firefighting server issues, could finally focus on improvements rather than keeping old hardware alive. Since migration, they've achieved 99.9% uptime, and production downtime due to IT issues has dropped by 85%.</p>

            <h3>When healthcare IT finally just works</h3>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"For years, I dreaded Monday mornings wondering what would be broken. Now I don't think about IT at all. When something goes wrong, they're on it in minutes. When our patient management system needed an urgent update, they had it done before our first appointment of the day."</p>
                <cite>Practice Manager, Auckland Medical Centre</cite>
            </div>

            <p>This busy Auckland medical centre had been struggling with their previous IT provider for years. Response times were slow, problems kept recurring, and nobody seemed to understand the specific requirements of a medical environment. Patient data security was a constant worry.</p>

            <p>When they switched to us, we started by properly documenting their environment and fixing the underlying issues that had been causing repeated problems. We implemented proper backup systems that met health sector requirements, secured their patient management system access, and set up monitoring that catches issues before they affect patient care.</p>

            <p>The biggest change was response time. When something goes wrong in a medical centre, you can't wait. We committed to 15-minute response for critical issues and we deliver on it. Their average support response time is now 12 minutes, and they've had zero patient data incidents since we took over.</p>

            <span class="case-tag">IT Roadmap</span>
            <h3>Growing through acquisition without the tech debt</h3>
            <p>A Wellington consulting firm was growing rapidly through acquisition. Each company they acquired brought different systems, different security approaches, and different ways of working. Integration was becoming a nightmare, and they needed a coherent strategy.</p>

            <p>We worked with their leadership team to understand where they were headed, then built a technology roadmap aligned with that vision. Rather than trying to standardise everything immediately, we prioritised the changes that would deliver the most value. Security came first, then collaboration tools, then gradually consolidating other systems.</p>

                <div class="outcome-label">The result</div>
                <div class="outcome-text">Over 18 months, we helped them integrate four acquisitions smoothly. New staff can be productive within days of joining because the core systems are consistent. Security is centralised and managed properly across all entities. And when they acquire the next company, there's a proven playbook to follow.</div>

            <span class="case-tag">Incident Response</span>
            <h3>Ransomware on Friday, back to work on Monday</h3>
            <p>A community organisation discovered ransomware on their network one Friday afternoon. By the time they noticed, several systems were encrypted. They called us in a panic, expecting the worst.</p>

            <p>Because they were already a managed services client with proper backups in place, we were able to contain the spread immediately and begin recovery. We isolated affected systems, identified the entry point (a compromised third-party vendor credential), and started restoring from clean backups.</p>

            <p>By Monday morning, they were back to normal operations. Some work from Friday afternoon was lost, but that was all. Without proper backups and a response plan, they could have lost years of donor records, programme data, and organisational knowledge. The total cost of the incident was a few hours of disruption rather than weeks of recovery or paying a ransom. Full recovery took under 48 hours with less than 4 hours of data loss, zero ransom paid, and the lessons learned strengthened their defences going forward.</p>
