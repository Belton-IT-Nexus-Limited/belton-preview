                Every business assumes their data is backed up until something goes wrong. A ransomware attack encrypts your servers. A hardware failure takes down your database. Someone accidentally deletes the wrong folder. When it happens, the question isn't whether you have backups. It's whether those backups can actually get you back to work.
            </p>
            <p class="section-intro">
                We've seen both outcomes. Businesses that lost years of work because their backup hadn't run properly in months. And businesses that were back online within hours because someone had done the job right. The difference isn't luck. It's having systems designed for recovery, not just backup.

            <p class="section-intro">
                We design backup systems with recovery in mind. Not just "can we get data back" but "how quickly can we get you operational again?" For critical systems, that might mean spinning up virtual machines in the cloud while we rebuild on-premise infrastructure.

            <p class="section-intro">
                A backup that hasn't been tested is a backup you're hoping works. We run regular restore tests and provide proof your data is actually recoverable.

                <p>Our primary backup solution for workstations and servers. Files are encrypted and backed up continuously to secure cloud storage. Works on any network, including home WiFi for remote workers. Includes bare metal recovery for full system restores and LocalSpeedVault for fast local recovery when you need it.</p>
                <p>For servers, we provide full image and file-level backup with application-aware protection for SQL Server and Exchange. Virtual disaster recovery can spin up standby images in the cloud within minutes.</p>

                <p class="solution-meta">Hosted or on-premise deployment</p>
                <p>For organisations with more complex requirements, we offer Veeam in two flavours. <strong style="color: var(--text);">Hosted Veeam</strong> gives you enterprise backup capabilities without the infrastructure overhead. We manage the Veeam environment in our data centre, with immutable repositories and offsite replication included.</p>
                <p><strong style="color: var(--text);">Local Veeam</strong> deployments make sense when you need backup infrastructure on-site. We design, deploy, and manage Veeam environments tailored to your storage and retention requirements, with SureBackup automated recovery testing to prove your backups actually work.</p>

                <p>All-in-one backup appliances for organisations where downtime isn't an option. Datto combines local backup with cloud replication and instant virtualisation. If your server dies, you can boot from the backup appliance and keep working while we sort out the hardware.</p>
                <p>Screenshot verification of every backup proves your systems are recoverable. Ransomware detection alerts us to suspicious changes before they spread. When disaster strikes, cloud failover gets you running in minutes, not days.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's retention policies aren't backup. When someone deletes a mailbox, corrupts a SharePoint site, or encrypts OneDrive files with ransomware, you need independent recovery. We back up Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams with point-in-time recovery and granular restore options.</p>
                <p>Beyond Microsoft 365, we protect other SaaS applications your business depends on. Google Workspace, Salesforce, Xero, MYOB, and cloud storage services. If your business data lives in the cloud, we can protect it.</p>

                Modern ransomware doesn't just encrypt your live data. It specifically targets backups, deleting or encrypting them to ensure you have no recovery option except paying the ransom. Standard backup won't save you.
            </p>
            <p class="section-intro">
                Immutable backups are copies that cannot be modified or deleted, even by an attacker with admin credentials. When ransomware strikes, you have a clean recovery point that the attackers couldn't touch. No ransom negotiations. No paying criminals. Just restore and move on.

            <p class="section-intro">
                Combined with off-site replication to secure New Zealand data centres, your data survives both cyber attacks and physical disasters. AES-256 encryption protects data in transit and at rest.

            <p class="section-intro">
                Backup is one part of business continuity. The broader question is: if something major went wrong, how would your business keep operating? Do you know which systems are truly critical? How long can you survive without them?
            </p>
            <p class="section-intro">
                We help you think through these questions before they become urgent. Business impact analysis identifies what really matters and what downtime actually costs. Recovery objectives define how quickly you need to recover and how much data loss is acceptable.
            </p>
            <p class="section-intro">
                Then we document the plan. Clear procedures, communication protocols, and step-by-step runbooks mean recovery happens smoothly when it matters. We also run tabletop exercises where your team walks through scenarios and identifies gaps before they matter.
