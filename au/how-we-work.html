        <h1 class="page-title">We become part of your team</h1>
        <p class="page-subtitle">Not just another vendor. A technology partner who understands your business, answers the phone, and actually cares about getting things right.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="page-section texture-dots">
        <div class="prose">
            <p>Most of the businesses we work with came to us after a bad experience. Their IT person left and took all the passwords. Their provider took days to respond. They got hit with surprise bills. They weren't sure if they were actually secure. These stories are depressingly common in our industry.</p>

            <p>We do things differently. Not because we read it in a business book, but because we've been running this company for twenty years and we know what works. Month-to-month agreements instead of multi-year lock-ins. One predictable monthly invoice instead of hourly billing that punishes you for asking questions. Proactive monitoring that catches problems before you notice them. And when you do need help, we actually pick up the phone.</p>

            <p>The IT industry has trained people to expect mediocre service. Tickets that sit for days. Engineers who don't understand the business. Technology decisions driven by vendor kickbacks rather than client needs. We've built Belton to be the opposite of all that.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>"The best technology partnerships feel invisible. You shouldn't have to think about IT constantly. It should just work, and when it doesn't, someone should be there immediately to make it right."</p>
                <cite>Jason Agnew, CEO</cite>
            </div>

            <p>What we've learned over two decades is that good IT support isn't about fancy tools or buzzwords. It's about being reliable, responsive, and honest about what you actually need. It's about understanding your business well enough to anticipate problems. It's about building trust through consistent delivery, not promises.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="page-section page-section--alt texture-grid">
        <div class="prose">
            <div class="section-tag">Getting Started</div>
            <h2 class="section-title">How we bring new clients on board</h2>

            <p>The onboarding process sets the tone for everything that follows. We take it seriously because we know that first impressions matter, and because we genuinely need to understand your environment before we can support it properly.</p>

            <p>It starts with a conversation. Not a sales pitch with slick presentations and pressure tactics, just an honest discussion about your business, your challenges, and what you're trying to achieve. We ask a lot of questions. What's working well with your current setup? What keeps breaking? What does your team complain about? Where do you want to be in two years? These conversations tell us more than any technical audit ever could.</p>

            <p>If it looks like we're a good fit, we'll do a proper assessment of your environment. Not a cursory glance that leads to a cookie-cutter proposal, but a thorough review of your infrastructure, security posture, and current processes. We look at everything: your network, your devices, your cloud services, your backup strategy, your security tools, your licensing. We document what we find, identify the gaps, and build a picture of where you actually stand.</p>

            <p>From there, we create a plan. Sometimes it's simple: take over support, clean up a few things, and get you onto a sustainable path. Sometimes it's more involved: address critical security gaps, migrate legacy systems, rebuild foundational infrastructure. Either way, we're transparent about what we recommend and why. We'll tell you what's urgent, what can wait, and what's optional. No manufactured urgency to drive up the first invoice.</p>

            <h3>The transition itself</h3>

            <p>Switching IT providers can feel daunting. We've done it hundreds of times, so we know how to make it as painless as possible. We get access to your systems, gather documentation from your previous provider (or create it from scratch if none exists), and gradually take over responsibility. Your team barely notices the change, except that suddenly things work better and someone actually answers when they call.</p>

            <p>The first few months are intensive. We're learning your environment, your team's work patterns, your quirks and preferences. We're fixing the backlog of issues that have been bothering people for years. We're implementing proper monitoring so we can catch problems proactively. We're making sure your security isn't held together with duct tape and hope.</p>

            <p>By the end of the first quarter, we know your business almost as well as you do. We know which systems are critical and which can wait. We know who your power users are and who needs extra patience. We know your busy periods, your compliance requirements, your growth plans. That knowledge is what transforms us from a vendor into a genuine partner.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">What partnership looks like day-to-day</h2>

                <p>After onboarding, the relationship shifts into ongoing partnership mode. This is where most IT providers drop the ball. They're great during the sales process, decent during implementation, and then gradually fade into the background, only appearing when there's a billing issue.</p>

                <p>We stay engaged. Your team has direct lines to our engineers. When they call, they get someone who knows their name and their setup. We're monitoring your systems around the clock, catching problems before they become outages. We're applying security patches promptly. We're reviewing your backup logs daily. We're watching for unusual activity that might indicate a breach.</p>

                <p>Beyond the day-to-day, we're thinking strategically about your technology. Quarterly business reviews where we discuss what's working, what's not, and what's coming. Technology roadmaps that align with your business goals. Budget forecasting so you're never surprised by a major expense. Vendor management so you don't have to deal with Microsoft support or your ISP directly.</p>

                <p>The goal is simple: you shouldn't have to think about IT. It should just work, and when it doesn't, you should know exactly who to call and trust that they'll handle it properly.</p>

            <div class="section-tag">The Difference</div>
            <h2 class="section-title">Why we're not like other IT providers</h2>

            <p>We've worked with enough businesses who've had bad IT experiences to know exactly what breaks the typical provider relationship. It's rarely one big failure; it's death by a thousand cuts. Slow responses that become normal. Bills that creep up without explanation. Security that's assumed rather than verified. Engineers who don't understand the business context. A growing sense that the provider cares more about the contract than the relationship.</p>

            <p>We've built Belton to be the antidote to all of that. Here's what actually makes us different:</p>

            <h3>Month-to-month agreements</h3>
            <p>We don't lock you into multi-year contracts. If we're not delivering value, you should be free to leave. This keeps us accountable and ensures we earn your business every single month. The fact that our average client relationship lasts over seven years tells you that this approach works.</p>

            <h3>Predictable pricing</h3>
            <p>One monthly fee per user that covers everything: support, security, monitoring, patching, the lot. No hourly billing that punishes you for asking questions. No nickel-and-diming on every request. You know exactly what you're paying, and you can budget accordingly. The only extra charges are for major projects that we scope and quote separately.</p>

            <h3>Real people who know your name</h3>
            <p>When you call us, you get someone who knows your environment and remembers your last conversation. Many of our engineers have been with us for over a decade. That continuity means you're not constantly re-explaining your setup to strangers. You're working with people who understand your business context and can provide advice that actually makes sense for your situation.</p>

            <h3>Honest advice, even when it costs us</h3>
            <p>We don't recommend products because of vendor kickbacks. We don't push expensive solutions when simpler ones will do. When something isn't right for your business, we'll tell you, even if it means less revenue for us. Our reputation is built on trust, and we're not willing to compromise that for short-term gain.</p>

            <h3>Security that's actually security</h3>
            <p>Too many providers treat security as a checkbox exercise. They install an antivirus, tick the box, and move on. We approach security holistically: defence in depth, continuous monitoring, incident response planning, regular testing. We're genuinely paranoid about your security because we've seen what happens when things go wrong.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Three ways to engage with us</h2>

                <p>Not every business needs the same level of IT support. Some want us to handle everything. Some have internal IT and need specialist backup. Some just need help with specific projects. We've structured our services to accommodate all three scenarios.</p>

                <h3>Fully managed IT</h3>
                <p>For businesses without internal IT staff, we become your complete IT department. Your team calls us directly when something breaks. We handle everything: support, security, patching, backup, planning. One monthly fee, no surprises. This is how most of our clients work with us, and it's the model that delivers the most value.</p>

                <h3>Co-managed IT</h3>
                <p>For businesses with internal IT, we provide expert backup. Security expertise when you need it. Someone to call when your person is stuck. After-hours and holiday coverage. Project overflow capacity. Your team stays in control; we're just the safety net they can rely on.</p>

                <h3>Project and advisory</h3>
                <p>Not ready for ongoing support? That's fine. We also do project work: office moves, cloud migrations, security assessments, system deployments. Fixed-price scoping, clear deliverables, no ongoing commitment. We also offer virtual CIO services for businesses wanting senior IT guidance without the full-time salary.</p>
