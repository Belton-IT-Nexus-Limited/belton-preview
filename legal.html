            <p>6.4 Subject to clause 6.5, the Customer must pay all invoices in full without set-off or deduction of any kind.</p>

            <p>6.5 If the Customer wishes to dispute an invoice, it must notify the Supplier in writing within 14 of the date of the invoice and provide details of the dispute. The Customer may withhold payment of the disputed part of an invoice only and must pay that part (or any amount subsequently agreed or determined to be the correct amount owing) promptly on resolution of the dispute.</p>

            <p>6.6 Without limiting any other remedies available to the Supplier for late payment or failure to pay any amount due, if any amount due is not paid by the Customer by the due date, the Supplier may:</p>
            <p>(a) charge the Customer interest calculated at 2% on the balance of the amount due by the Customer from the due date until payment is received in full by the Supplier; and/or</p>
            <p>(b) charge the Customer all collection costs reasonably incurred by the Supplier in collection of the amount outstanding (including solicitor and/or collection agency fees); and/or</p>
            <p>(c) on 5 Working Days' notice in writing, suspend delivery of further Products, Deliverables and Services until the outstanding amount is paid in full.</p>

            <p>6.7 Unless otherwise specified in the relevant Associated Agreement, the Supplier may increase its pricing for Products, Deliverables and Services from time to time but not more often than once every 12 months. One month's notice in writing will be given.</p>

            <h2>7. Taxes</h2>

            <p>7.1 In addition to the amounts due under clause 6, the Customer will pay the Supplier amounts equal to any applicable government taxes or duties however designated, based on this Agreement (or the Products and Services provided under it), paid or payable by the Supplier in respect of the foregoing, exclusive however of taxes based on the Supplier's income.</p>

            <h2>8. Customer Data - GDPR</h2>

            <p>8.1 Subject to clause 8.2, the Supplier will access the Customer Data only as required in the performance of the relevant Contract.</p>

            <p>8.2 Without limiting clause 9, the Supplier will only access the Customer Data and disclose the Customer Data to law enforcement or government authorities to the extent required by law. If a request for Customer Data is made by a law enforcement agency or government authority (whether directly to the Supplier or through Microsoft or a third party vendor), the Supplier will redirect the request to the Customer or if redirection is not permitted or feasible in the available time frame and unless legally prohibited from doing so, the Supplier will notify the Customer of the request as soon as practically possible.</p>

            <p>8.3 Nothing in this Agreement transfers ownership of the Customer Data to the Supplier.</p>

            <h2>9. Personal Data and Data Protection</h2>

            <p>9.1 The Customer consents to the Processing of Personal Data by the Supplier for the purposes of the applicable Contract. Before providing Personal Data to the Supplier, Customer will obtain all required consents from third parties (including Customer's contacts, partners, distributors, administrators, and employees) under applicable Data Protection Laws.</p>

            <p>9.2 To the extent permitted by applicable law, Personal Data collected by the Supplier under a Contract may be transferred, stored and processed in the State(s) and/or country (or countries) in which the Supplier maintains facilities or any other country in which the Supplier's contractors or service providers (including for example Microsoft and other third party vendors) maintain facilities.</p>

            <p>9.3 In the event of any Personal Data Breach, the Supplier will comply with its obligations, including notification obligations, (if any), under applicable Data Protection Laws.</p>

            <h2>10. Confidential Information</h2>

            <p>10.1 Each party agrees to:</p>
            <p>(a) hold in confidence all Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party and disclose that information to its directors, employees and contractors only to the extent required in the performance of the Contract;</p>
            <p>(b) ensure that all Confidential Information is protected at all times from unauthorised access or use by, or disclosure to, any third party or misuse, damage or destruction by any person.</p>

            <p>10.2 A party may disclose the other party's Confidential Information if and to the extent required by law if it first notifies the other party of the obligation to disclose the Confidential Information, provided that a party is not required to notify the other party under this clause if it is not legally permitted to do so or if the timing within which the party is required by law to disclose the Confidential Information does not permit notification to the other party.</p>

            <h2>11. Intellectual property</h2>

            <p>11.1 The Supplier or its licensors own the Intellectual Property in the means, methods, processes and know-how used by the Supplier to provide the Products, Deliverables and Services and to otherwise perform the Supplier's obligations under the Associated Agreements.</p>

            <p>11.2 The provisions relating to Intellectual Property ownership in relation to particular Products, Deliverables and Services are included in the relevant Associated Agreement.</p>

            <h2>12. Warranties</h2>

            <p>12.1 Each party warrants that it has all requisite right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement.</p>

            <p>12.1 (a) The Supplier warrants that Managed Services will be provided in accordance with the Service Levels (if any) set out in the applicable Associated Agreement, and otherwise with reasonable skill and care.</p>

            <p>12.2 Except as provided under clause 12.1 and in any express warranties contained in an Associated Agreement, to the extent permitted by law, all warranties, terms and conditions (including without limitation, warranties and conditions as to fitness for purpose and merchantability) implied by legislation or otherwise, are excluded by the Supplier.</p>

            <h2>13. Termination of Contracts</h2>

            <p>13.1 Except where a Contract has a fixed term, either party may terminate a Contract at any time without cause on giving thirty days' notice in writing to the other party.</p>

            <p>13.2 Either party may terminate a Contract immediately (or with effect from any later date that it may nominate) by written notice to the other party if:</p>
            <p>(a) one or more Insolvency Events occurs in relation to that other party. For the purposes of this clause, 'Insolvency Event' means, in respect of a party (other than for the purpose of solvent reconstruction or amalgamation):</p>
            <p class="indent">i. a receiver, manager or liquidator is appointed over the party's undertaking or assets or the party enters into any assignment, composition or arrangement with its creditors; or</p>
            <p class="indent">ii. the party is unable to pay its debts when due or is deemed unable to pay its debts under any law or suspends payment to its creditors.</p>
            <p>(b) the other party commits a material breach of any of its obligations under the Contract and fails to remedy that breach within 30 days of prior written notice for each incident of such breach. For the purposes of this clause 13.2 (b), non-payment by the Customer for a period of 30 days or more after due date of any undisputed invoice constitutes a material breach by the Customer.</p>

            <p>13.3 Additional rights of termination that apply to individual Associated Agreements may be included in each of those agreements.</p>

            <h2>14. Consequences of termination</h2>

            <p>14.1 On termination of a Contract, in addition to any other consequences of termination included in the relevant Associated Agreement and without limiting either party's rights or remedies:</p>
            <p>(a) each party will, on request, return the other's Confidential Information in its possession or control in respect of that Contract except for copies that it may be required to hold for compliance, audit or legal reasons;</p>
            <p>(b) all amounts owed to the Supplier under the Contract which accrued before termination will be due and payable in accordance with the payment terms in that Contract;</p>
            <p>(c) the Supplier will deliver to the Customer all Deliverables paid for by the Customer.</p>

            <p>14.2 On any termination of a Contract, see clause 20.4 Survival of Obligations</p>

            <h2>15. Liability</h2>

            <p>15.1 This limitation does not apply to claims by the Customer for bodily injury or damage to real property or tangible personal property for which the Supplier may be legally liable.</p>

            <p>15.2 Provider will not be liable beyond the amount set forth in clause 15.3, for any loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by any act or omission of the Provider under or in connection with this Agreement. The Provider will not be liable for any loss or damage to the extent caused by any act or omission of the Client or its affiliates or other providers to perform their responsibilities.</p>

            <p>15.3 The maximum aggregate amount payable by the Provider, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, in relation to any claims, liabilities (including any liability of the Client to a third party), losses or expenses, will be $500,000.</p>

            <p>15.4 Except in respect of payment liabilities, neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to reasons beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, acts of war, earthquake, flood, explosion, fire, strike, insurrection, riot, labour trouble, work interruption, embargo, sabotage, governmental act, loss of IP address or failure of the Internet, provided the delayed party gives the other party prompt notice of the reasons for such cause</p>

            <p>15.5 Client acknowledges that Provider would not enter into this agreement without these limitations on liability</p>

            <p>15.6 The limitation of liability included in clause 15 will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>

            <h2>16. Dispute Resolution</h2>

            <p>16.1 In the event of any dispute arising between the parties in relation to a Contract, no party may commence any proceedings relating to the dispute (except where the party seeks urgent interlocutory relief) unless that party has complied with the procedures in this clause 16.</p>

            <p>16.2 The party initiating the dispute ("the first party") must provide written notice of the dispute to the other party ("the other party") and nominate in that notice the first party's representative for the negotiations. The other party must within fourteen days of receipt of the notice, give written notice to the first party naming its representative for the negotiations ("Other Party's Notice"). Each nominated representative will have authority to settle or resolve the dispute. The parties will co-operate with each other and endeavour to resolve the dispute through discussion and negotiation.</p>

            <p>16.3 If the dispute is not resolved within one month following the date of the Other Party's Notice (or such longer period as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties), either party may utilise any other legal remedies available to it in seeking to resolve the dispute.</p>

            <h2>17. Non-Solicitation</h2>

            <p>17.1 Neither party will, without the written consent of the other party, solicit, employ, or otherwise engage the services of, the other party's personnel (including employees and contractors). This clause will apply from commencement of the first Contract between the parties and will continue until there has been no Contract between the parties for a continuous period of six months (and if there is subsequently a Contract between the parties the non-solicitation period will re-commence).</p>

            <p>17.2 A party may as a condition of granting its consent under clause 17.1 above, require the other party to pay to it a fee of up to 50% of the person's gross annual remuneration to cover the cost of replacing the employee or contractor.</p>

            <h2>18. Notices</h2>

            <p>18.1 Any notice or other communication in connection with a Contract must be:</p>
            <p>(a) marked for the attention of the primary contact person and delivered or sent to the address of the other party by prepaid post or email, as set out in the relevant Associated Agreement.</p>

            <p>18.2 Notices or other communications are deemed received:</p>
            <p>(a) if delivered by hand, on delivery;</p>
            <p>(b) if delivered by post:</p>
            <p class="indent">i. on the fifth Working Day following posting if sent and received within Auckland; and</p>
            <p class="indent">ii. on the tenth day following posting if posted internationally; or</p>
            <p>(c) if sent by email, on sending the email provided that no email is successfully sent if the sender receives any type of delivery notification failure and provided further that the onus is on the sender to ensure that the email has been successfully received by the recipient.</p>

            <h2>19. Force majeure</h2>

            <p>19.1 Either party may suspend its obligations to perform under a Contract if it is unable to perform as a direct result of a Force Majeure Event. Any such suspension of performance must be limited to the period during which the Force Majeure Event continues.</p>

            <p>19.2 Where a party's obligations have been suspended pursuant to clause 19.1 for a period of 30 days or more, the other party may immediately terminate the Contract by giving notice in writing to the other party.</p>

            <h2>20. General</h2>

            <p>20.1 Assignment: The Customer is not permitted to assign its rights under a Contract without the prior written consent of the Supplier. Except as otherwise provided in an Associated Agreement and subject to compliance by the Supplier and/or the assignee with any applicable third party vendor requirements in respect of the assignment, there is no restriction on assignment by the Supplier of its rights or obligations under a Contract.</p>

            <p>20.2 Contractors: The Supplier may perform its obligations under a Contract by the use of the Supplier-selected independent contractors.</p>

            <p>20.3 Other agreements: Subject to clauses 10 and 11, nothing in these terms and conditions prevents the Supplier from entering into similar agreements with others or from providing products, deliverables or services which are similar to the Products, Deliverables or Services provided under a Contract.</p>

            <p>20.4 Survival of Obligations: Upon termination or expiry of this Contract, any provisions that, by their nature or express terms, are intended to survive termination will remain in full force and effect. These include, but are not limited to, clauses relating to confidentiality, intellectual property, indemnities, dispute resolution, and any accrued rights or obligations.</p>

            <p>20.5 Entire agreement: Each Contract constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties, superseding all proposals or prior agreements, oral or written, and all other communications between the parties relating to the subject matter of that Contract.</p>

            <p>20.5 Further assurances: The parties must each do all such further acts (and sign any documents), as may be necessary or desirable for effecting the transactions contemplated by the Contract.</p>

            <p>20.7 Amendments: Except as specifically provided, no amendment to a Contract will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties.</p>

            <p>20.8 Waiver: No exercise or failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right or remedy by a party will constitute a waiver by that party of that or any other available right or remedy.</p>

            <p>20.9 Partial Invalidity: If any provision of a Contract or its application to any party or circumstance is or becomes invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of the Contract and its application will not be affected and will remain enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

            <p>20.10 Relationship of the Parties: The parties agree that the Supplier is an independent contractor to the Customer and that nothing in these terms and conditions or any Contract constitutes a partnership, joint venture or relationship of employer and employee between the parties. Neither party may:</p>
            <p>(a) act or hold itself out as an agent or representative of the other party; or</p>
            <p>(b) assume or create any obligations on behalf of the other party.</p>

            <h2>21. Governing Law</h2>

            <p>21.1 Each Contract is governed by the laws of New Zealand. The parties hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New Zealand.</p>
